## Overview

### Development

Run `yarn start` to see your app at `localhost:3000`

### Building & Deploying

1. Run `yarn build`, which will compile all the necessary files to the
`build` folder.

2. Upload the contents of the `build` folder to your web server's root folder.

### Structure

The [`app/`](../../../tree/master/app) directory contains your entire application code, including CSS,
JavaScript, HTML and tests.

The rest of the folders and files only exist to make your life easier, and
should not need to be touched.

*(If they do have to be changed, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/issues)!)*

### CSS

Utilising [tagged template literals](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#tagged-template-literals)
(a recent addition to JavaScript) and the [power of CSS](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/blob/master/docs/css-we-support.md),
`styled-components` allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components.
It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a
low-level styling construct could not be easier!

See the [CSS documentation](./css/README.md) for more information.

### JS

We bundle all your clientside scripts and chunk them into several files using
code splitting where possible. We then automatically optimize your code when
building for production so you don't have to worry about that.

See the [JS documentation](./js/README.md) for more information about the
JavaScript side of things.

### SEO

We use [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) for managing document head tags. Examples on how to
write head tags can be found [here](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet#examples).

### Testing

For a thorough explanation of the testing procedure, see the
[working standards](./working-standards/README.md)!

#### Browser testing

`yarn start:tunnel` makes your locally-running app globally available on the web
via a temporary URL: great for testing on different devices, client demos, etc!

#### Unit testing

Unit tests live in `test/` directories right next to the components being tested
and are run with `yarn test`.
