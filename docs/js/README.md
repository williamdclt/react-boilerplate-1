## State management

This boilerplate manages application state using [Redux](redux.md) and keeps access performant
via [`reselect`](reselect.md).

For managing asynchronous flows (e.g. logging in) we use [`redux-saga`](redux-saga.md).

For routing, we use [`react-router` in combination with `react-router-redux`](routing.md).

We include a generator for components, containers, sagas, routes and selectors.
Run `yarn generate` to choose from the available generators, and automatically
add new parts of your application!

> Note: If you want to skip the generator selection process,
  `yarn generate <generator>` also works. (e.g. `yarn generate component`)

## Architecture: `components` and `wrappers`

We adopted a split between stateless, reusable components called (wait for it...)
`components` and stateful parent components called `wrappers`. We do not use the
terminology `containers` because it is commonly attached to redux's `connect`, which
is only a higher order component amongst all the HoCs that can be in your wrapper.
